    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a square or rectangular chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a
        variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always,
        have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips,
        or other ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is
        called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century
        and popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>They are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with ice cream (<em>a la mode</em>),
        topped with
        whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North America, they are common homemade treats and
        they are also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses</p>
